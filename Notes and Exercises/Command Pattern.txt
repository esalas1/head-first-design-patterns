# The Command Pattern

The command pattern encapsulates requests as an object. 

### *Exercise: How does the deisign of the Command Pattern support the decoupling of the invoker of a request and the receiver of the request*
The invoker speaks directly to the concrete command object and is not in the same scope as
any of the receivers. The invoker knows that if it issues a command, the request will be received
and the correct action will be performed. The request is encapsulated as a part of the 
command's structure. Each command performs its own action independently of everything else. 
This leads to a decoupled system and allows for a modular design where the user
can easily add or remove commands without consequently modifying the entire system.
