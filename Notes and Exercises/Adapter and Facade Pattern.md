# Adapter and Facade Pattern

## Adapter Pattern
This pattern lets us convert the interface of one class to another class so it can be compatible with downstream processes. 

The adapter pattern lets us use a client with an incompatible interface by using an Adapter that performs the necessary conversion to the needed interface. 

The object adapter uses composition to pass the request to the Adaptee (The object that is getting disguised by the adapter)
