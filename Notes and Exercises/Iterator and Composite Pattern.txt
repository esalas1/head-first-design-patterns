# Iterator and Composite Patterns


## Iterator Pattern

Relies on the Iterator Interface. 
Relies on two methods: 
- HasNext() - tells us if there is another element in the collection 
to iterator through.
- Next() - returns the next object in the collection.
- Aggregates are also called collections. Refers to group of objects. 
- used to access objects sequentially without exposing the underlying 
implementation (Array, List, etc.).
- Iterators apply no Ordering.

**Classes should have only one reason to change**
- If we add multiple responsibilities to classes
anytime the responsibilities change, the class needs to change.
Classes with multiple responsibilities are therefore more 
likely to change, making the code less maintainable. 
- High cohesion is the result of following this principle. 
- "Framework" refers to a set of classs and interfaces.
