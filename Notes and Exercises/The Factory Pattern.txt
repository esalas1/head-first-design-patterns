# The Factory Pattern
- Factories handle the details of object creation.


---
### *Exercise: How might you take all parts of your application that instantiate concrete classes and separate or encapculate them from the rest of the applcation?*
- Move this process over to a class that takes care of instantiating 
these objects. Encapsulate the process that creates these classes.

### *Exercise: How can we use object composition to swap in and out of implementations in our PizzaStore?*
- We can add variations of the original Pizza creator with specific differences that fulfill the user's needs.

## Factory Method
- handles object creation and encapsulates it in a subclass.
- The superclass and client do not know what kind of object is being created in the subclass.
